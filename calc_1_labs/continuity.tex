\title{Continuity and Discontinuity}
\begin{dialogue}
\item[Julia]What does it mean for a graph to be discontinuous? I don't get it!
\item[Dylan] I think it's like when there's a hole in the graph or something.
\item[James] Actually there are different kinds of discontinuities, but it's hard to visualize so let's take a look!
\item[Altogether] LET'S DIVE IN!

\section{Introduction}
\begin{question}
A function $f$ is said to be \textit{continuous at a point} $x = a$ if three conditions are satisfied:
\begin{selectAll}
\choice[correct]{$f(a)$ is defined}
\choice{$f(a) \neq 0$}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ exists}
\choice[correct]{$\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a} f(x)=f(a)$}

\end{selectAll}
\end{question}
