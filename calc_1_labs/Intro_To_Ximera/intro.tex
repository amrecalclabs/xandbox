\item[Dylan] Woah, what's this blank box?
\item[Julia] Looks like we put our answer in it? But how do I know how to format it?
\item[James] Don't worry you two! Ximera is pretty smart, so as long as what you put in is equivalent to the answer Ximera knows, it should work fine! Check it out down here!

\begin{question}
Go ahead and put in $2x^2$ into the following blank:

$\answer{2x^2}$

Now, the answer to this box is $2x^2$ as well, but try $2*(x)*(x)$ or $2x*x$!

$\answer{2x^2}$
\end{question}
