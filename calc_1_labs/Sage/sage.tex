\section{Introduction}
If you ever want to use a sage cell when one is not provided, or would like to experiment with Sage Cells, you can follow this \link[link]{https://sagecell.sagemath.org/}
\section{Functions in Sage}
To define a function you write $f(x)=x^2$, do so in the following cell and evaluate.
\begin{onlineOnly}
\begin{sageCell}

\end{sageCell}
\end{onlineOnly}
\begin{question}
What output did you get from evaluating the function?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{None}
\choice{$f(x)=x^2$}
\choice{$x^2$}
\end{multipleChoice}
\begin{feedback}
All we did was define a function, to see the function definition type $f(x)$
\end{feedback}
\end{question}
