\begin{abstract}
SageMath is a computer algebra system, throughout these labs sage cells will be used for certain problems. This lab introduces you to the basics of using a sage cell.

\section{Introduction}
If you ever want to use a sage cell when one is not provided, or would like to experiment with Sage Cells, you can follow this \link[link]{https://sagecell.sagemath.org/}.
\section{Functions}
To define a function you use the notation in the following sage cell:
\begin{onlineOnly}
\begin{sageCell}
f(x)=x^5+3*x+4
\end{sageCell}
\end{onlineOnly}
\begin{question}
What output did you get from evaluating the sage cell?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{None}
\choice{$f(x)=x^5+3x+4$}
\choice{$x^5+3x+4$}
\end{multipleChoice}
\begin{feedback}
All we did was define a function, to see the function definition type f(x).
\end{feedback}
Evaluate the function at $x=3$ by typing f(3) in the sage cell, what did you get? $\answer{256}$
\end{question}
If you don't use function notation, must define your variables before using them like in the following Sage Cell.
\begin{onlineOnly}
\begin{sageCell}
var('x y')
eqn=4*x+y==1
solve(eqn,y)
\end{sageCell}
\end{onlineOnly}
\begin{question}
From the sage cell above, what can you say about ``=" vs ``=="?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{``=" is used for assignment and ``==" is used to signify equality}
\choice{``=" is used to signify equality and ``==" us used for assignment}
\end{multipleChoice}
\begin{feedback}
\textit{Note that you need to include the * operator, go back and take out the * to see how Sage Does error messages and debugging.}
\end{feedback}
\end{question}
